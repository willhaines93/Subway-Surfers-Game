# Subway-Surfers-Game
This program was created using pygame and was created as a final project for a grade 12 computer science class. The project was made to demostrate the use of classes, functions, and most other components of python coding that were learnt throughout the two years of computer science. It is a very unpolished game however there were other projects that came up at the time and was unable to fully finish this game.

The game workes very similar to the popular phone game Subway Surfers. As the main character runs up the screen you as the player must jump over cars and duch under barriers. The game also has an instructions screen and a charcater selections screen where you are able to change the character that you are using.
